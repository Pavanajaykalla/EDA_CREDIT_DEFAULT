# EDA_CREDIT_DEFAULT

**Problem statement**

A loan-providing company wants to identify the customers who are potential defaulters for credit loans to identify the risk.
The loan-providing companies find it hard to give loans to people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. 
Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. 
Suppose you work for a consumer finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers.

**Business Objectives**

This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
